<!-- <p style="text-align: justify;">
Now is the perfect time for experiment design and active learning methods to make serious headway on a variety of modern challenges and domains. For example, many experiment design tasks involve vast and unstructured search spaces (e.g., the number of potential drug-like molecules is estimated between 10^23 and 10^60), immense amounts of unlabeled data, costly experiments, constraints in the data collection process, the potential for massive parallelism in experimentation, and corrupted or disagreeing measurement outcomes. We are particularly interested in understanding the current issues preventing the broad application of experiment design and active learning methods to these challenges, as well as initial successes.</p> -->

We welcome submissions of 4-6 pages (excluding references) in [JMLR Workshop and Proceedings format](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-journal-of-machine-learning-research-jmlr-with-jmlr2e-dot-sty/vjcpxhvztrjn). Submissions should be non-anonymous. All accepted papers will be presented as posters (recently published or under-review work is also welcome). There will be no archival proceedings, however, the accepted papers will be made available online on the workshop website. Papers should be submitted [here via EasyChair](https://easychair.org/cfp/realml-icml2020).

[Note: the deadline has been **extended by one week**] The work should be submitted by **22nd June 2020, 11:59 PM (Anywhere on Earth)**.

Technical topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
* Large-scale and real-world experiment design (e.g. biological/molecular/drug design, physics, robotics, crowdsourcing, citizen science, algorithms, etc.) 
* Efficient active learning and exploration
* High-dimensional, scalable Bayesian and bandit optimization (e.g. contextual, multi-task)
* Sample-efficient interactive learning, hypothesis and A\B testing
* Corrupted or indirect measurements, multi-fidelity experimentation
* Incorporating domain-knowledge such as physics
* Safety and robustness during experimentation and of resulting designs



## Camera-Ready Instructions
Camera-ready papers should be at most 6 pages (excluding references and appendix), using the [customized JMLR template linked here](camera_ready_jmlr_tex_template.zip).
All papers must be sent by **July 15, 2020, 11:59 PM (Anywhere on Earth)** to the following email address: realml.icml2020@gmail.com

Note that there will be no archival proceedings. However, the camera-ready papers will be made available on the workshop website.


## Lightning Talk Instructions
During the workshop, we will host a round of lightning talks for all accepted papers, where an author from each paper will have the chance to talk about their work live via Zoom, for up to 2 minutes (using slides). Slides must be in PDF format, and sent to organizers in advance, by July 15. Organizers will click through slides while authors speak. Slides will be made available on the workshop website.
Here are the key details:
* **Talk date/time:** 5:10 - 6:40 PM UTC on the day of the workshop (July 18, 2020).
* **Talk details:** Each talk should be under 2 minutes, using any number of slides. Talks should summarize the main ideas and results of the paper. During each talk, organizers will click through slides while authors speak.
* **Slide format:** Slides should be in PDF format.
* **Submitting slides:** Slides must be sent by **July 15, 2020 (end of day, Anywhere on Earth)** to the following email address: realml.icml2020@gmail.com

Note that we are hosting lightning talks in lieu of a poster session. However, for authors who wish to make and share a poster, we will provide a way for posters to be shared on our website. If you wish to do this, please email us at realml.icml2020@gmail.com.
